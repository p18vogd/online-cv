    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am results-oriented, constantly checking in with the goal to determine how close or how far away we are and what it will take to make it happen. 
      I find this pressure inspiring and a great motivator for the rest of the team. I am also dedicated hardworking and  highly organized .
      I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines.I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method so I’m always able to find what I need.
